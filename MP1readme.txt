The goal of this project is to create an application that manages quiz scores for 3 students. 
The user will have to input how many quizzes each student has, each students' name, and the 
program will calculate the class average, student average, and quiz average. The user can then 
choose to see the calculations after choosing an option on the menu system. The user has to press 
x to exit the program.
